# vocal

This is an R package designed to support checking whether data complies with a standard. 

The goal is that the package can be used with multiple standards, but our emphasis is to develop it to work with the [terminag](https://github.com/carob-data/terminag/) standard used in the [Carob project](https://github.com/carob-data/carob/).  

You can install the package with:

```
remotes::install_github("carob-data/vocal")
```
